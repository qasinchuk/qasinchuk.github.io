# ðŸŽ® CVScan â€” Retro Hiring Simulator

CVScan is a retro, Papersâ€‘Pleaseâ€“inspired hiring simulator. Review randomized CVs and emails, match candidates to vacancies, and decide who to hire or reject while managing credits, boss satisfaction and your career score.

This README reflects recent gameplay and UI updates implemented in index.html (spam/virus handling, spam filter behavior, extra time pressure, hotkeys, leaderboard fixes and defensive rendering).

## Quick Summary of Changes

- Spam filter:
  - If the currently visible letter is spam, running the Spam Filter grants an immediate bonus and advances to the next applicant (no spam-filter cost in this case).
  - Otherwise the filter costs credits and scans a short lookâ€‘ahead window to remove spam/malicious CVs (no immediate bonus).
  - Rejecting spam grants a small reward; hiring spam applies a significant penalty (credits + warnings).
- Virus / Harassment emails:
  - Rejecting yields a larger bonus.
  - Hiring a virus email triggers an immediate game over (computer infected).
- Economy & penalties:
  - Correct decisions: +10 credits.
  - Mistakes: âˆ’10 credits plus a warning.
  - Hiring salary cost: 10 + 5 Ã— (# required skills).
  - VIP, Legend and special events implemented with bonuses/penalties.
- Extra time pressure:
  - When enabled on Start, Day 1 is shortened to 60 seconds (highâ€‘pressure start).
- Hotkeys:
  - H = Hire, R = Reject, S = Spam Filter, Space = Quick Reject/Next, ? = Help.
- UI / Stability improvements:
  - Defensive rendering to avoid freezes on missing data (missing fields show placeholders).
  - Fixes to prevent game freeze on missing DAYS data; active day config saved to currentDayCfg.
  - Spam, virus and leaderboard handlers added to avoid ReferenceErrors.
- Leaderboard & Export:
  - Leaderboard saved to localStorage and shown via overlay.
  - Export CSV log (decisions include event, missing required, violations, credits after, time left).
- Misc:
  - Discrepancies panel is hidden by default (increased challenge).
  - Rivals (optional) may auto-hire attractive candidates when you delay.

## How to Play (updated)

1. Open the page and click START. Optionally enable Rivals and Extra time pressure.
2. Read the incoming email + CV in the center panel.
3. Select the correct vacancy (should match the applicantâ€™s "Applied Role").
4. Compare CV skills to Required Skills â€” each requirement shows OK / MISSING.
5. Review Day Rules (rules/checks apply per day). The Discrepancies panel may be hidden.
6. Decide:
   - HIRE if the candidate matches requirements and rules.
   - REJECT otherwise.
7. Use Spam Filter:
   - If the current visible letter is spam, running the filter grants an immediate bonus and advances to the next applicant (no cost).
   - Otherwise it costs credits and removes spam/malicious CVs in a lookahead window.

Scoring & Economy: Correct decisions +10 credits, mistakes âˆ’10 credits (+warning). Hiring deducts salary = 10 + 5 Ã— (# required skills). Rejecting spam rewards; hiring spam penalizes heavily. Hiring a virus email ends the game.

## Development & Testing

- Open index.html in a modern browser (tested on macOS).
- Game state, sound settings and leaderboard persist in localStorage.
- To test spam/virus behavior: start a run and interact with Spam Filter / Hire / Reject when event CVs appear.
- If you see console errors, check that index.html includes the latest helper definitions (runSpamFilter, showBoard, salaryOf, verdict exposed properly) and that DOM ids (btnStart, btnHire, btnReject, btnSpam, boardOverlay, boardList) exist in the page.
